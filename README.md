Some projects:
-
[Yousaybot](https://github.com/laptopoutofbattery/Yousaybot) - a discord bot that plays the song "You say run" in voice channels  
nameinprogress - a Pokemon related discord bot (currently in progress, have yet to create a repository)  

<br>

Intended projects for the future (so i don't forget):
-
App dev (for a school related project)  
More Python and C++ dev (GUIs or others, hopefully not another niche discord bot)

hopefully I come up with more useful ideas...
